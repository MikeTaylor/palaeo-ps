It is a follow-up to [our 2021 paper in _Qeios_](https://www.qeios.com/read/1G6J3Q.5) which argues that pneumatic diverticula followed blood vessels during development.

[The manucript itself](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PworL5JEztVrn8fDE7qG0MfJBkKYwpDNoSjPy8ZULyg/edit) is in Google Docs for ease of collaboration.
