The three files in here are the end-state of Figures 1-3 as Matt prepared them, each in its own file with some redundancy.

Preparators to adding dorsal vertbrae to each of these, I condensed the three files into [a single one with layer groups](../../Figures\ 1-3.xcf), so the files in this directory are superseded by that.
