This is a preprint, to be posted on Zenodo, of the text as it was at the time of submission to PeerJ -- so the source document is ../files-for-upload/Wedel and Taylor pneumaticity and vasculature ms.docx plus the images in ../../figures/export/

(We need this so we can cite the preprint in the Acta Pal Pol paper about pneumatic ribs in Brachiosaurus.)
